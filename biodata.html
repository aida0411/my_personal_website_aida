		<dt><b>_About Myself_</b></dt><br>
		<dd>Hello Guys...... my name is Aida Syafiqah Binti Amirudin, i'm from Klang, Selangor. I am now 20 years old, and my birthday is April 11, 2002. I am a Diploma in Information Management, Faculty of Information Management, UITM Kelantan Branch Machang Campus, semester 5 student. </dd> <br>
		<dt><b>_My Hobby_</b></dt><br>
		<dd>My most recent hobby has been watching anime series and films. This is because it is enjoyable and can help me relax while studying. In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime with my friends. Furthermore, it can provide me with new knowledge, such as the opportunity to learn Japanese from watching the series.</dd><br>
		<dt><b>_My Dream_</b></dt><br>
		<dd>My dream is to have a stable career in the future. This is because the increasingly challenging life in Malaysia at work makes me aspire to have a stable career that suits my interests. Now I'm trying to strengthen my understanding of foreign languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin to get better job opportunities. By having a stable career, I can travel to my dream countries, such as Japan, Korea, the United States, and Switzerland.</dd>
